                <p>
                  ADEPARTAR was founded in 1974 by Glenn and Daisy Hickinbottom who rescued three chickens, a goat, and a siamese cat named Ed from their commune in Donner Pass, Colorado. They moved to the Cincinnati area, as news of their absconding wouldn't be received until a decade later, according to Samuel Clemens.

                <blockquote><i>~If the world comes to an end, I want to be in Cincinnati. Everything comes there ten years later. -Samuel Clemens~</i></blockquote>
                <p>
                  Once they arrived, the goat had been eaten, one of the chickens had been hit by a car, and the cat ran away with the spoon. After that, the Hickinbottoms swore they would help all the little critters find a home where they never had to worry about their tenuous position in the food chain or philandering flatware.

                <p>
                  Our mission is to never eat another pet, and to make sure all of our little orphans go to homes where they are loved - just not for their meat.
